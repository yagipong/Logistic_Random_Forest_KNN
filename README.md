# Logsitic_Random_Forest_KNN
A comparative analysis of Logistic Regressions, Random Forest Models, and KNN Models

This analysis tracks the utility of three types of classification models to determine which is best suited to predict the risk of breast cancer. The comparative analysis tracks the outcomes of the models across several metrics that test their capacity to understand the data presented and make predictions.

From this analysis, it can be seen that the logistic regression model was perhaps the most complex model of the three, but the KNN model produced the best results.
